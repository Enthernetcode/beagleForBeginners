### How to Use This Script
1. **Introduction**: This section introduces the user to the BeagleBone platform and the purpose of the script.
2. **Setup and LED Blinking**: This part of the script demonstrates how to set up GPIO pins and blink an LED. It includes code that continuously blinks an LED until interrupted.
3. **Interactive Shell**: Users can practice their skills by running Python commands directly in an interactive shell. This is useful for experimenting with GPIO commands.
4. **Quiz**: A quiz section to test the user's knowledge about GPIO setup and usage in BeagleBone.

### Running the Script
- Make sure you have the Adafruit_BBIO library installed on your BeagleBone.
- Connect an LED to the specified GPIO pin (P9_14 in this case).
- Run the script on your BeagleBone.
- Follow the instructions provided by the script to learn and interact with the GPIO.
